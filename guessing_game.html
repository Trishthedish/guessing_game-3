          Dear Professor
        </p>
        <p id="letter_body">
          Ten years ago, NASA secretly established communications with the intelligent alien
          lifeforms that had been hiding out in our solar system for years. After a decade of
          sending Earth’s best academic journals—via radio wave—into space, Solar System
          University’s board of trustees has allowed a satellite campus to be opened on earth.
          SSU Earth is opening its shiny metal doors soon, and you’ve been selected as its
          first Professor of Terrestrial History.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Wáxblürk, Vice Provost, SSUE
