In this game, the player is a new professor of history at Solar System University's Earth campus.
The player can define a historical date, or choose one from a list, and then must explain to alien
students how long ago the event happened in their own planets' years. Students are only so patient, and
the class period is only so long, but the player mush try to answer as many students correctly as
they can!

Comparison of current date and chosen date (line 33) from stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/542938/how-do-i-get-the-number-of-days-between-two-dates-in-javascript)

Collaborated with Hana and Sue.
